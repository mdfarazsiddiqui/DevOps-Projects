## What is DevOps?

DevOps is basically a culture that organization adopt in the development and operations of software. It will improve the delivery of application.

Suppose there is org called example.com and they want to introduce a new feature so if they are taking 10 days to introduce this version everything is done let's say the development is done and everything else apart from the delivery. if they have to hold their application for 10 days just to deliver right to deliver to the unit staging then the staging environment then finally to the production it is basically not a good practice.
Ideally it should take hours or a day to add a new feature, bug, security issue etc.

So In short devops is about increasing & improving the ability to deliver the application in shorter time.

Automation - is also a key factor is devops

Quality - The quality plays a major role in devops

Monitoring - In order to check the efficienvy, quality etc there must be monitoring

Testing - Application should be thoroughly tested

_Devops is a process of improving the application delivery making your delivery quicker by ensuring that there is a proper automation you have ensured that the quality is in place you have ensured that you have set up proper monitoring and you have ensured that you have a continuous testing._

Manual Intervention should be reduced. Suppose a company is taking 2 weeks to deliver an application, so it should be reduced without compromsing the quality of the application.
